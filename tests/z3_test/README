Note: all tests should complete with exit code 0 and no output.
Some of the tests require 2 devices.

- [mmap] create buffer + mmap + fill
- [draw] draw_line, dump & check output
- [draw_ro] attempt to draw on read-only buffer
- [large_wait] wait with large param
- [invalid_cmd] invalid commands send to device,
- [pagefault1] invalid operation list
- [pagefault2] invalid buffer addr
- [partial_op] attempt to execute part of operation
- [crossmap] mapping buffer from devA to devB
- [dumb_map] mapping of non-buffer
- [crossdraw] check if 2 contexts have separate virtual memory (1 device)
- [buf_zero] buffer of size 0
- [large_alloc] perform large allocation
- [draw_double_mmap] double mapping of the same buffer
- [invalid_cmd2] run with invalid params
- [invalid_ioctl]  invalid ioctl addr
- [overflow] try access memory outside buffer
- [unmap_invalid_addr] try unmapping invalid buffer
- [large_op] execute large set of operations and attempt to release resources w/o wait
